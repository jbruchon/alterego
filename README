You can customize the directory used by AlterEgo and other options that 
affect its compilation by editing the file "config.h"

Running "make" and "make install" with no changes will create /sbin/alterego 
with a default root of /i386 and with the SMALL option disabled.

To throw out all message text and reduce the size slightly, uncomment the 
entry for "#define SMALL" in config.h

If you wish to install AlterEgo to a different location, use DESTDIR:

make DESTDIR=/packages/staging install

Then, make the symlinks for the programs you need; for example, running:

ln -s /usr/bin/alterego /usr/bin/firefox

will redirect /usr/bin/firefox to transparently do the equivalent of:

chroot /i386
/usr/bin/firefox
